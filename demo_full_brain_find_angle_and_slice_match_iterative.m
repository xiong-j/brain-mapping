%% output and output files:
% x - rotation angle around the dorsal ventral axis
% y - rotation angle around the left-right axis
% correspondences - a vector of matching indices for each experimental slice in the experimental stack
% tif file - qualitative result: matching pairs generated by our program
% mat file - saves x,y,correspondences
%% instructions on how to use the result
% in the atlas folder, there are many rotated atlas files. In each file, it
% contains two variables: 1. tatlas (the rotated atlas volume). 2. origin
% (4 dimensions (size of tatlas, plus 3), this varibale saves in the unrotated (sectional atlas) each
% volxel in the rotated atlas comes from. so if you want to know where
% (coordinate x, coordinate y, in slice z in the rotated atlas) is in the
% unrotated atlas, simple read origin(x,y,z,:) This variable allows you to
% combine our algorithm with manual or other 2D registration algorithms or
% do other flexible tasks.
%% do not modify under this line
% name of the output mat file to save the diffs matrix 
% with this matrix you can see a clear pattern: left is more negative and
% right is more positive. The best angle should be the angle that is closer
% to zero at the flipping point. If this pattern is clear then it means our
% algorithm is confident about the output; if not, then you will need to
% better preprocess the experimental dataset or/and the (sectional) atlas.
